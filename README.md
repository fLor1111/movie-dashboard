# Movie Dashboard

Hey! This is my **Movie Dashboard** project. It's a small React app where you can browse, search, and check out info about movies and TV series. I used data from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/).  

I built this mainly as a fun project for my second year in programming, but it also helped me practice React, Tailwind CSS, and working with APIs.

## What it does

- Search for any movie or TV series by name.
- See the latest movies and popular TV shows on the home screen.
- Click on a movie or series to open its IMDb page.
- Loading spinner while data is fetching.
- Works on both desktop and mobile screens.
- Sticky footer giving credit to IMDb.

## Tech stuff

- **React 19** – for building the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS** – makes styling quick and clean.
- **Vite** – fast dev server and build tool.
- **PropTypes** – just to keep my code type-safe.

## How to run it

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
